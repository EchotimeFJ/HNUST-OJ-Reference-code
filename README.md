# HNUST-OJ-Reference-code
# My purpose
This Repository is my first Github program.
I want to let my friends or schoolmates have a reference code when they are doing programmings.😜
# The reason why it will exist
Because although they can't solve it, they will also look for reference code. I'd better make a summary.😁
# some code details
The code I submit will be placed according to my pass order, and readers can see a little improvement in my code level (if you are my loyal fan)🤔
# ===the end===
Please give me a star⭐ to support my efforts.Thank you so much!😘
