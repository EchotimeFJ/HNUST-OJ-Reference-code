# HNUST-OJ-Reference-code
# My purpose
This Repository is my first Github program.
I want to let my friends or schoolmates have a reference code when they are doing programmings.😜
# The reason why it will exist
Because although they can't solve it, they will also look for reference code. I'd better make a summary.😁
# Some code details
I will store most of the questions according to the number of the questions I have passed. Most of the questions were done when I was a freshman in my university. It should be helpful for you. Now you star⭐ me. You are an old and loyal fan.🤔
# ===The end===
Please give me a star⭐ to support my efforts.Thank you so much!😘
